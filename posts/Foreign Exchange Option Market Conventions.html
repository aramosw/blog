				<h1>Foreign Exchange Options Market Conventions</h1>
				<p class="meta">2025-11-13</p>
				<h2>FX Spot Market</h2>
				<p>
					Currency pairs are commonly quoted using ISO codes in the
					format FORDOM, where FOR is the foreign currency and DOM is
					the domestic currency. For example, in the EURUSD pair, EUR
					is the foreign currency and USD is the domestic currency.
					The FX spot rate, $x$, for the currency pair FORDOM
					represents the number of units of DOM is needed to buy one
					unit of FOR. The domestic currency is also referred to as
					the numeraire currency.
				</p>
				<h2>FX Forward Contract</h2>
				<p>
					A forward contract allows an investor to exchange currencies
					at a time, $T$, at a pre-specified outright forward rate,
					$f$. The outright forward rate is related to the spot rate
					by interest-rate parity,
					$$f=\mathbb{E}[S_T]=xe^{(r_d-r_f)\tau},$$ where $r_d$ is the
					domestic interest-rate, $r_f$ is the foreign interest-rate
					and $\tau$ is the time to maturity ($T-t$).
				</p>
				<p>
					At inception, an outright forward contract has a value of
					zero. Thereafter, when markets move, the value of the
					forward contract is no longer zero but is worth the
					discounted difference between the expected exchange rate,
					$f$, and pre-specified outright forward rate, $K$.
					$$e^{-r_d\tau}(f-K)=xe^{-r_f\tau}-Ke^{-r_d\tau}.$$
				</p>
				<p>
					It is also worth mentioning that FX Forward contracts are
					oftened quoted as FX Forward Points. This is the difference
					between the spot exchange rate and forward outright point as
					basis points. $$\tilde{f}=10000\times(f-x).$$
				</p>
				<h2>FX Vanilla Option Contracts</h2>
				<p>
					An option contract is simply (not so simple to be honest) an
					extension of a forward contract. It provides the investor
					the right, but not the obligation, to exchange currencies at
					a time $T$ at a pre-specified rate known as the strike, $K$.
					The key part here is the additional optionality as in the
					name. In FX markets, these contracts are usually physically
					settled. This means that at expiry, the owner of a vanilla
					FORDOM call (put) option receives $N$ units of FOR and pays
					$NK$ DOM. Intuitively, the additional optionality comes at a
					cost. This cost is what traders and market makers want to be
					able to gauge accurately and is the ultimate motivation for
					everything we discuss in option theory.
				</p>
				<p>
					The value of a vanilla option can be computed with the
					standard Black-Scholes model.
					$$V(x,K,T,t,\sigma,r_d,r_f,\phi)=\phi
					e^{-r_d\tau}[f\mathcal{N}(\phi d_+)-K\mathcal{N}(\phi
					d_-)].$$ The following terms have been abbreviated for
					simplicity:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>$\tau:=T-t$</li>
					<li>$f:=\mathbb{E}[S_T]=xe^{(r_d-r_f)\tau}$</li>
					<li>
						$\theta_\pm:=\frac{r_d-r_f}{\sigma}\pm\frac{\sigma}{2}$
					</li>
					<li>
						$d_\pm:=\frac{\log(\frac{x}{K})+\sigma\theta_\pm\tau}{\sigma\sqrt{\tau}}=\frac{\log(\frac{f}{k})\pm\frac{\sigma^2}{2}\tau}{\sigma\sqrt{\tau}}$
					</li>
					<li>
						$n(x):=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}x^2}=n(-x)$
					</li>
					<li>
						$\mathcal{N}(x):=\int_{-\infty}^{x}n(t)\text{d}t=1-\mathcal{N}(-x)$
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Delta Conventions</h2>
				<p>
					The delta of an option is the percentage of the FOR notional
					one must buy when selling the option to hold a hedged
					position. For instance, a delta of 0.35 (35%) indicates
					buying 35% of the FOR notional to delta-hedge a short
					option.
				</p>
				<p>
					In FX markets, we distinguish spot delta, used for a hedge
					in the spot market, from forward delta, used for a hedge in
					the forward market. Furthermore, the standard delta is a
					quantity in percent of foreign currency. Suppose the value
					of an option with a notional of 1,000,000 FOR was calculated
					as 73,669 DOM. Assuming a short position with a delta of 40%
					means, that buying 400,000 FOR is necessary to hedge.
					However the final hedge quantity will be 326,331 FOR which
					is the delta quantity reduced by the received premium in
					FOR. Consequently, the premium-adjusted delta would be
					32.63%.
				</p>
				<h3>Unadjusted Deltas</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Spot delta: The sensitivity of a vanilla option's
						premium with respect to the spot rate, $x$, is given as,
						$$\Delta_s(K,\sigma,\phi):=\frac{\partial V}{\partial
						x}=\phi e^{-r_f\tau}\mathcal{N}(\phi d_+).$$
					</li>
					<li>
						Forward delta: An alternative solution to a spot hedge
						is a hedge with a forward contract. The sensitivity of a
						vanilla option's premium with respect to the outright
						forward rate, $f$, is given as,
						$$\Delta_f(K,\sigma,\phi):=\frac{\partial V}{\partial
						f}=\phi\mathcal{N}(\phi d_+).$$
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Premium-Adjusted Deltas</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Premium-adjusted spot delta: This takes care of the
						correction induced by payment of the premium in FOR
						currency, which is the amount by which the delta hedge
						in foreign currency has to be corrected. The delta can
						be represented as,
						$$\Delta_{s,pa}:=\Delta_s-\frac{V}{x}=\phi
						e^{-r_f\tau}\frac{K}{f}\mathcal{N}(\phi d_-).$$
					</li>
					<li>
						Premum-adjusted forward Delta: As in the case of a spot
						delta, a premium payment in foreign currency leads to an
						adjustment of the forward delta. The resulting hedge
						quantity is given by,
						$$\Delta_{f,pa}(K,\sigma,\phi):=\Delta_f-\frac{V}{f}=\phi
						e^{-r_f\tau}\frac{K}{f}\mathcal{N}(\phi d_-).$$
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Sadly, which deltas are used in practice varies depending on
					the currency pair and cannot be attributed to a rule-based
					system.
				</p>
				<h2>At-The-Money Conventions</h2>
				<p>
					As you are probably figuring out for yourself, nothing is
					straightforward in the options market. There tends to be two
					prominent ways of defining the at-the-money (ATM) strike.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Forward ATM: This takes into account that the
						risk-neutral expectation of the future spot is the
						forward price, which is a natural way of specifying the
						middle. It is very common for currency pairs with a
						large interest rate differential (emerging markets) or
						long maturity (typically 10Y onwards).
					</li>
					<li>
						Delta-neutral saddle (DNS): This ensures that a straddle
						(long call and long put with the same strike) has zero
						combined delta. The strike that satisfies this is the
						ATM strike. This convention is considered as the default
						notion for short-dated FX options (up to 1Y typically).
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The table below summarises the different delta conventions
					as well as ATM conventions.
				</p>

				<h3>Delta-Strike Mapping</h3>
				<p>
					While it is common in equity markets to quote
					strike-volatility or strike-price pairs, this is usually not
					the case in FX markets. It is standard to receive implied
					volatility-delta pairs from market data providers. The
					investor is then tasked with transforming implied
					volatility-delta to strike-price pairs respecting the delta
					and ATM conventions. This section will outline the
					algorithms which can be used to that end.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is straightforward to compute strikes from unadjusted
					deltas. However, since explicit strike expressions in
					premium-adjusted deltas are not available, we must solve for
					the strikes numerically. For a given spot delta, $\Delta_s$,
					and corresponding volatility, $\sigma$, the strike can be
					retrieved explicitly.
					$$K=f\exp\left(-\phi\mathcal{N}^{-1}\left(\phi
					e^{r_f\tau}\Delta_s\right)\sigma\sqrt{\tau}+\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2\tau\right).$$
					The equivalent forward delta defintion is given below.
					$$K=f\exp\left(-\phi\mathcal{N}^{-1}\left(\phi\Delta_f\right)\sigma\sqrt{\tau}+\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2\tau\right).$$
				</p>
				<p>
					For a premium-adjusted forward delta, we obtain the
					following equation.
					$$\Delta_{f,pa}(K,\sigma,\phi)=\phi\frac{K}{f}\mathcal{N}(\phi
					d_-)=\phi\frac{K}{f}\left(\phi\frac{\log\left(\frac{f}{K}-\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2\tau\right)}{\sigma\sqrt{\tau}}\right).$$
					This cannot be solved for strike in closed-form, it must be
					solved using a numerical procedure. This is straightforward
					for put delta because the put delta is monotone in strike.
					This means we can employ a simple procedure such as the
					bisection or secant method. This is not the case for the
					call delta. Different schemes can be employed here such as
					Brent's root searcher, Newton-Raphson method, Nelder-Mead
					simplex, etc.
				</p>
				<h2>Implied Volatility Smiles and Surfaces</h2>
				<p>
					To reiterate, in FX markets it is common to use the delta to
					measure the degree of moneyness. Consequently, volatilities
					are assigned to deltas (for any delta type), rather than
					strikes. For example, it is common to quote the volatility
					for an option which has a premium-adjusted delta of 0.25.
				</p>
				<p>
					The curve constructed by interpolating through various
					volatility-delta pairs is called the volatility smile. It is
					called a smile because this curve exhibits skewness and
					curvature resembling that of a smile. In FX markets, the
					volatility smile is given implicitly as a set of
					restrictions implied by market instruments. This is
					FX-specific, as other markets quote volatility versus strike
					directly. A consequence is that one has to employ a
					calibration procedure to construct a volatility versus delta
					or volatility versus strike smile.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, the volatility smile is not static. It varies with
					maturity, leading to a volatility surface. The volatility
					surface is a function of both moneyness (delta or strike)
					and time to maturity.
				</p>
				<p>
					The key part of construction is to build a curve such that
					it matches the market quotes. The FX market uses three
					volatility quotes for a given delta (typically 0.25 and
					0.10). Simply, we aim to build a curve function $\sigma:A\to
					B$ that maps strikes to implied volatility such that
					$\sigma(K_{\text{ATM}})=\sigma_{\text{ATM}}$,
					$\sigma(K_{25-\text{RR}})=\sigma_{25-\text{RR}}$ and
					$\sigma(K_{25-\text{BF}})=\sigma_{25-\text{BF}}$.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>ATM volatility, $\sigma_{\text{ATM}}$</li>
					<li>
						Risk reversal (RR), $\sigma_{25-\text{RR}}$: A risk
						reveral is a strategy where you are long an
						out-of-the-money (OTM) call and short an OTM put with
						the same expiry and underlying currency pair.
					</li>
					<li>
						Butterfly (BF), $\sigma_{25-\text{BF}}$: A call
						butterfly (call fly) is a strategy where you are long a
						low-strike call, short two middle-strike calls and long
						a high-strike call. All options have the same expiry,
						strikes are spaced evenly and share the same underlying
						currency pair.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Risk reversals are used to measure the skewness of the
					smile, the extra volatility added to the 0.25$\delta$ put
					volatility compared to the 0.25$\delta$ call volatility.
					Call flies are used to measure the curvature of the smile,
					the extra volatility added to the 0.25$\delta$ put and call
					volatility compared to the ATM volatility. Often, a
					simplified formula is used to easily calculate the 0.25
					delta volatilities given these quotes. Let
					$\sigma_{25-\text{C}}$ be the volatility of a call with
					delta of 0.25 and \sigma_{25-\text{P}}$ be the volatility of
					a put with delta of 0.25. Then,
					$$\sigma_{25-\text{C}}=\sigma_{\text{ATM}}+\frac{1}{2}\sigma_{25-\text{RR}}+\sigma_{25-\text{BF}},$$
					$$\sigma_{25-\text{P}}=\sigma_{\text{ATM}}-\frac{1}{2}\sigma_{25-\text{RR}}+\sigma_{25-\text{BF}}.$$
				</p>
				<p>
					The last step in this process is now to employ some
					volatility smile calibration technique. This could be a
					polynomial interpolation, local volatility model such as
					Dupire's, stochastic volatility model such as SABR, and many
					more. We will touch on this in future posts!
