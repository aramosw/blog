# My Math Blog (static template)

This is a minimal, static blog template that supports LaTeX via MathJax.

## How to use
1. Open `index.html` in a browser to see the homepage.
2. Edit the posts in `posts/`. Copy any post to make a new one and add a link to it in:
   - the homepage `index.html`
   - and optionally `posts/index.html`
3. Publish by uploading this folder to GitHub and enabling Pages, or deploy to Netlify/Vercel.

## Writing math
- Inline math: `$e^{i\pi}+1=0$`
- Display math: 
  ```
  $$
  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} \, dx = \sqrt{\pi}
  $$
  ```
