# Borrowed Thoughts

This repository contains the source code for my personal website - a collection of thoughts, notes, and explorations related to **mathematical finance**, **quantitative investing**, **mathematics and statistics**, **data**, and **software engineering**, as well as whatever else happens to catch my interest.

I’m not a front-end engineer, so the visuals are simple (lazy), but that’s intentional. The focus is on content rather than polish — sharing ideas, explanations, and observations that I find interesting or entertaining as I navigate the quantitative space.

Everything here is static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks, no build tools, just a lightweight setup that renders LaTeX, code, and general ramblings in one place.

Thanks for visiting, and I hope you find something worth reading.
